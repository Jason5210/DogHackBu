						<br> Favorite place to go – Road trips
						<br> Qualifications – N/A
						<br> Bio – Why hello there! I’m Sam. I’m pretty relaxed - sleeping would without a doubt be my Favorite thing to do, maybe besides eating.

Road trips are great - I get to be in the backseat, relaxing with a nice breeze coming in through the window, and if my owner opens it up, sticking my head out feels awesome!
