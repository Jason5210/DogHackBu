		<h1>About</h1>

		<p>This website was designed to be the go-to site for dogs of all types to find the perfect match, whether that be for breeding purposes, companionship, or just a playdate in the dog park. We intended to allow users to input information about their dogs and then display profiles of dogs of the opposite gender. Here are some quotes from some satisfied customers:
			<br> "Wow! Very love. Much good" - Doge the Shiba
			<br> "DAMN IT MOON MOON!" - MoonMoon's spouse the Husky
			<br> "It's the one and only d oh double g" - Snoop Dogg

	<h1>Meet the Developers</h1>
	<h2>Json(Jason)</h2>
	<p>I’m just a Chinese boy from Stony Brook taking that 4 hour bus down here to this hackathon to be harassed by these three Binghamton imbeciles who have no idea how to code practically. Thanks for the idea yo.</p>

	<h2>Xi Thong(Xi Zhong) </h2>
	<p>A Cantonese prodigy, a product of the cult Jhin Bodhi. My mother’s fifty dollar wooden prayer beads helped get to where I am. I have a tendency to do illegal stuff but I didn’t do anything illegal at this hackathon, I promise.</p>

	<h2>DyLAN Party(Dylan Pan)</h2>
	<p>I like to play video games. Mass Effect Andromeda? I’m on that deluxe edition yo. CS:GO? I’m basically a pro. Rainbow Six siege is my life because counter strike is life tilting. I’m here because I want to fail CS120 but have a reason for doing so.</p>

	<h2>AiDONE(Aidan Uy)</h2>
	<p>I don’t really know how to code but like I want something to put on my resume. I learned how to code Java and Python but like how do I use this?? HTML is super easy but I still have no idea what I’m doing. Tbh I’m done with this project so I did all the typing into a google doc stuff lol.</p>

	<h2>Crystal Low IQ</h2>
	<p>I was supposed to show up but like I forgot to make a resume. I could’ve e mailed HackBU or something but I was too busy not being able to read English for my CS140 assignments. I stayed for seven hours in my lab. Three of those were spent reading the instructions and I still got them wrong.</p>
